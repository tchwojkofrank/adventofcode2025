Code for both parts is a bit ugly. Might clean it up another time.
## Part 1
Graphs in the guise of circuits.
This is a bit ugly and can be optimized for memory a fair bit.
I keep a list of distances (weighted edges), and an index that is sorted by those distances.
## Part 2
Still graphs, just different aspects.
