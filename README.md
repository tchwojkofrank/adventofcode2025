# adventofcode2025

My coding is rusty and sloppy. I'm very much out of practice. I'm doing this quickly as I have time, and focusing more on completion than style or any sort of neatness

This year I'm using Go. I don't have the brain space to both solve the problems and learn a new langauge at the same time this year.

## Spoilers
I'm going to put a readme in each day's folder, so there are more spoilers beyond just the poorly commented code.
