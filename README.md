# adventofcode2023

My coding is rusty and sloppy. I'm very much out of practice. I'm doing this quickly as I have time, and focusing more on completion than style or any sort of neatness

This year I'm using Go, though I considered Rust. I don't have the brain space to both solve the problems and learn a new langauge at the same time this year. I may go back and port this to Rust in January.

## Spoilers
I'm going to put a readme in each day's folder, sothere are more spoilers beyond just the poorly commented code.
